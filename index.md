# Morse Code Decoder

## What is this?

This website serves as documentation of our Fall 2019 Computer Architecture final project, a morse code decoder.

## Why did we do this?

(Other than this being a required assignment)
We chose to create a hardware-based morse code decoder because we viewed it as a fun extension of our learning throughout the semester in terms of the Verilog programming language, as well as concepts such as synchronization, finite state machines, and behavioral Verilog. In addition to this, we had less experience working with FPGAs (and the Vivado software), and felt that a hardware-based application of these concepts would allow us to learn more about implementing our simulations in other environments. This project has served as a lesson in the integration of modules and working around human interaction with our developed software, and posed some interesting questions and problems while we implemented what is essentially the first "binary" form of communication.
