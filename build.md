# Build Instructions

## General Setup (Do This First!)

1. Some software which is necessary before using our morse code decoder are [gtkwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) for viewing the results of simulation done of the device done with [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) as well as [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) in order to implement the hardware design on an FPGA. Note that in our testing we used the [Zybo
Zynq-7000 ARM/FPGA SoC Trainer Board](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/zybo/start).
2. After downloading the necessary software go out [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MarkG98/MorseCodeTranslator.git) and clone the `master` branch
